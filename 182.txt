/*
LeetCode Problem 182: Duplicate Emails

This SQL query finds all duplicate email addresses in a table named 'Person'.
Each record in the 'Person' table contains an 'Id' and an 'Email'.
The query returns a list of email addresses that appear more than once in the table.

Columns:
- Email: The email address that appears multiple times.

Approach:
- Group the records by the 'Email' field.
- Use the HAVING clause to filter groups with a count greater than one.
- Select only the 'Email' field for output.

Example:
Input:
+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+

Output:
+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
