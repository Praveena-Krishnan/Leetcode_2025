"""A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single 
file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.
You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. 
Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].
